### 2. Internship on PT.PJB

### 3. Control & Automation Lab.

### 4. SPBKLU

### 5. Apoci Research
Automatic Pond Circulation is a prototype designed for monitoring and controlling water quality. 
Water quality measured by pH, salinity, turbidity, & temperature sensor. As those variable fluctuated dynamicly, drain valve and inlet pump circulate fresh water according user setpoint.
This project getting 2nd award in Identik-Kominfo, 3rd in Kolabpreneur 2021

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
